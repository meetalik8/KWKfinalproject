          Karlie Elizabeth Kloss is an American fashion model. Vogue Paris declared her one of the "top 30 models of the 2000s" when she was 17.
<!--           Outside of modeling, Kloss has an interest in technology and has founded the "Kode with Klossy" camp, which aims to get young girls interested in STEM fields. -->
Kloss is a computer programmer. In April 2015, Kloss began partnering with Flatiron School and Code.org to offer an annual scholarship called Kode with Klossy for young girls interested in computer science and software engineering.In 2015, she also launched the Kode with Klossy two-week summer coding camp for girls from ages 13â€“18. As of 2018, the camp had expanded to include "50 coding camps in 25 US cities, teaching 1,000 girls to code."The camp teaches the basics of numerous programming languages, including: Ruby, JavaScript and Swift.By the end of the program, those partaking in the camp had built fully functional mobile apps or websites (like this one!).

      <h2> About the makers of this site!</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone! We're part of a web development team from Kode With Klossy! Our team consists of 3 members: Gulovsha, Meetali, and Srinidhi. Each of us are extremely passionate about empowering women and showing the world what we're really capabale of. We made this website to showcase amazing, talented, and intelligent women in many different disciplines. Each page consists of 4 women, each of which have accomplished amazing things in their dedicated field. As 3 women in STEM we often feel extremely underrepresented in this community, however; it is clear that women have paved the way for many amazing things, including coding!! Our goal is to educate those who, just like us, didn't realize the impact women have on our society today. We want to emphasize the amazing capabilities we can reach if we take the right steps! Hope you learn something! :))</p>
