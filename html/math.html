        <p style='display:inline;'>Alexandra Bellow is a Romanian-American mathematician, who has made contributions to the fields of ergodic theory, probability and analysis.Some of her early work involved properties and consequences of lifting. Lifting theory, which had started with the pioneering papers of John von Neumann and later Dorothy Maharam, came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s with the work of the Ionescu Tulceas and provided the definitive treatment for the representation theory of linear operators arising in probability, the process of disintegration of measures. Their Ergebnisse monograph from 1969 became a standard reference in this area. </p>

        <h5> Wikipedia</h5>
        <p style='display:inline;'>Eva Bayer-Fluckiger is a Hungarian and Swiss mathematician. She is an Emmy Noether Professor Emeritus at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. She has worked on several topics in topology, algebra and number theory, e.g. on the theory of knots, on lattices, on quadratic forms and on Galois cohomology. Along with Raman Parimala, she proved Serre's conjecture II regarding the Galois cohomology of a simply-connected semisimple algebraic group when such a group is of classical type. </p>

        <h5> Wikipedia</h5>
        <p style='display:inline;'>Tatyana Alexeyevna Afanasyeva was a Russian/Dutch mathematician and physicist who made contributions to the fields of statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics.Albert Einstein was a frequent guest in the 1920s at her home Witte Rozenstraat 57 in Leiden, witness the many signatures on the wall. Later Einstein departed for Princeton University and Afanasyeva corresponded. The archives of Museum Boerhaave in Leiden has three letters to her from Einstein.

Afanasjeva contacted Einstein for his advice on her manuscript on thermodynamics and inquired about a translator. She wanted to give thermodynamics a rigorous mathematical foundation which was lacking and describe pressure, temperature and entropy in changing systems. Einstein responded on 12 August 1947 that he applauded her approach but he also had some criticisms </p>

        <h5> Wikipedia</h5>
        <p style='display:inline;'>Maria Gaetana Agnesi was an Italian mathematician, philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian.She was the first woman to write a mathematics handbook and the first woman appointed as a mathematics professor at a university.According to Britannica, she is "considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics".She worked on integrating mathematical analysis with algebra.The first volume treats the analysis of finite quantities and the second of the analysis of infinitesimals.  </p>
